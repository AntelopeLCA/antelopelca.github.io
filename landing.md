# 🌱 Antelope LCA

## Elevating product models to an art.

##

Antelope is a framework for creating and sharing *product models* in LCA. The product model is the distilled effort put into describing a product system and constitutes the entirety of what makes your LCA study specific to you. 

### Why It Matters

LCA is not traditionally a collaborative effort.  However, the knowledge that is needed to make an *accurate* LCA study **comes from all over.** Antelope is a project to provide a way for different parties to 

 1. agree on the content of their models
 2. link up efforts without sharing data

Antelope consists of a set of computational tools to be run on a practitioner's computer ([antelope.py](https://github.com/AntelopeLCA)) and also a [cloud services platform](https://vault.lc/) for hosting and sharing models.

## What's here?

This site is dedicated to describing what Antelope is and how it works. The intended audience is primarily LCA practitioners and LCA-adjacent sustainability professionals.  

The two main areas of the site are the [guidebook](/guidebook) and the [blog](/posts/).  The blog posts are organized into problems (/tags/problems) and  solutions (/tags/solutions).
