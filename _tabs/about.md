Welcome to Post Oak Lab! My name is Ryan and this is where I document my IT and homelab projects.

### Why Post Oak?
I love oaks and post oak (*Quercus stellata*) is one of my favorites. Also "post" has a variety of meanings, making "post oak" somewhat ambiguous.

I'll leave you with this quote from Valentin Tomberg:
>Imagine, not an explosion, but rather the blossoming out of a constructive "atomic bomb"...each little acorn is such a "constructive bomb" and the oak is only the visible result of the "slow explosion"--or blossoming oak--of this bomb.
