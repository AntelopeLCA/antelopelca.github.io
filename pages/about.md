# About Me

Hi, I'm **Steven Kelly** â€” a developer and automation enthusiast based in Texas.

I specialize in CRM systems, custom bot development, and process automation.  
My recent projects include building GitHub Actions-powered bots, Rock RMS recipes, and integrations that make managing systems easier and faster.

I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like CRM management, church tech, and workflow optimization.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new tools, learning about automation, or working on creative projects.
