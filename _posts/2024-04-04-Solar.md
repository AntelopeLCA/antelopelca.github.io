# Solar Panel Performance Tool

The Solar Panel Performance Tool is a free tool designed to help you check the performance of solar panels at your location. It utilizes the pvlib library to accurately calculate the solar irradiance on your roof. To use this tool effectively, you need to provide three essential pieces of information:

1. **Location**: The tool requires the location of your home to determine the amount of sunlight hitting the solar panels.

2. **Size/Orientation of Your House**: Information about the size and orientation of your house is necessary to determine the number of solar panels required and the optimal angle for installation.

3. **Solar Panel System Information**: This includes details about the solar panel system, such as size, efficiency, and installation cost. These details are crucial for calculating energy production and cost savings.

## How it Works

1. **Location Input**: Provide your home's location details.
2. **House Size/Orientation Input**: Enter information about the size and orientation of your house.
3. **Solar Panel System Input**: Input details about your solar panel system, including size, efficiency, and installation cost.
4. **Analysis**: The tool calculates the solar irradiance on your roof, estimates energy production, and provides insights into potential cost savings.
