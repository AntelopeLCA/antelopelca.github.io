# Installing and setting up Python.


## Windows

### Check if you already have it installed.

- Do WinKey+R 
- Then type PowerShell
- Finaly press enter

Next you are going to want to type in:

`python --version`

If you see something like this:

`Python 2.10.7`

Then you have python installed but it may not be the latest version.


### Installing Python

So there are a few options for setting up python.
The first one is from the Microsoft store but i would not recommend that as it is a lot harder to setup integrations with IDE's like VSCode.
The second one is from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
