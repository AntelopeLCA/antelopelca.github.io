Antelope is a complete (though not yet fully comprehensive) LCA computing environment, but the first task it was created for is benchmarking of existing datasets. Today we are going to look at a Federal LCA Commons dataset that is the product of years of multi-stakeholder work across industry, academia, and state and federal government agencies: the Hot Mix Asphalt LCA Framework model prepared under the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Sustainable Pavement Project.  Read all about the Asphalt Framework [here](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/38470) (if you prefer 15-MB government project reports) or [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-020-01777-x) if you prefer paywalled academic articles.

You can follow along with this article with the [walkthrough]() (jupyter) in the User Support repository.

# Overview of the data source

The Asphalt Framework is a guidance document describing how LCA could be used effectively for pavement procurement.  The study, on the other hand, is an actual LCA that was conducted in support of a PCR for hot mix asphalt on behalf of the National Asphalt and Pavement Association (NAPA).  Read the [LCA study report](https://www.asphaltpavement.org/uploads/documents/EPD_Program/NAPA_LCA_2016.pdf).


## Obtaining the Repository

The study model was submitted to the US Federal LCA Commons. So, we go there to download it.
