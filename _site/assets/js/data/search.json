    "content": "https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/building-a-custom-malware-analysis-lab-environment/IntroductionBuilding the right malware analysis environment is the first step for every malware researcher. When all system configurations and software installations are complete, you’re able to analyze and investigate malware properly. In this post, I wanted to share my own experiences and scripts to help ease the workload of setting up a malware environment to explore malicious software.In this post, you will learn how to:  download, install and configure a free Windows 10 and a free REMnux Linux virtual machine  set up a virtual private network for communication between virtual machines  build a custom Windows malware environment with SentinelLabs RevCore Tools  learn how to capture network traffic from a Windows 10 virtual machineInstalling Virtual MachinesWhen running multiple virtual machines, the host operating system will begin slowing down, so it is critical to set each virtual machine’s best requirements to optimize its performance. To set up the virtual machines in this post, I recommend that the Windows 10 virtual machine be set with the minimum requirements of two processor cores with 4GB of RAM and the Linux virtual machine with two processor cores with 2GB of RAM.Downloading a Free Windows 10 InstallationMicrosoft provides a free virtual machine which is intended for testing IE and Edge web browsers. To download the Microsoft virtual machine go to https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ and download the MSEdge on Windows 10 zip file and select your preferred VM platform, currently I’m using VM Fusion.Downloading REMnux LinuxThe next virtual machine we want to download is REMnux Linux. The REMnux distro is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. It has excellent tools for exploring network interactions for behavioral analysis and investigating system-level interactions of malware. To download REMnux go to https://docs.remnux.org/install-distro/get-virtual-appliance and download the Virtual Machine platform of your choice.Installing and Configuring a Private Isolated Custom NetworkCreating an isolated, controlled network environment when analyzing malware is extremely important due to the level of interaction it gives you with malware. VMware Fusion gives you the capabilities to change key networking settings and add a virtual private network configuration to use for analysis between hosts. We will only add two virtual machines to this lab environment, but you can add many virtual machines to this network. The procedures to create this network is as follows:  Select the tab VMware Fusion-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Network; click the lock icon to make changes  Select the “+” button which creates a vmnet# under the Custom section.  Do not select the “Allow Virtual machines on this network to connect to external networks (using NAT)” option.  Add a Subnet IP: I’ve entered 10.1.2.0  Click ApplyWindows 10 SetupOnce you’ve created a custom network and both virtual machines have been downloaded, begin by unzipping the MSEdge Windows 10. Since I’m using VMware Fusion, I will go through how to import the virtual image; the process for importing the virtual machine with other platforms is similar.Open up VMware Fusion and follow these steps:  After the zip has been unpacked enter the MSEdge-Win10-VMware folder.  Select in VMware Fusion File-&gt;Import MSEdge_Win10_VMware, hit Continue and save the Virtual Machine; it will take a few minutes to import the image.  Click on Customize Settings after the image has been imported.  Click into the Processors &amp; Memory tab and confirm that the settings has two processor cores and the memory is 4096MB.  Before powering on the MSEdge Win10 virtual machine, take a snapshot and name it something like “VM Clean Import”.  When starting the virtual machine, if prompted to upgrade the virtual machine to greater feature compatibility support, choose Upgrade.  The password to the virtual machine is Passw0rd!  Open the command prompt to activate the virtual machine, type slmgr.vbs /ato.  When prompted, install VMware’s “Virtual Tools” and reboot.  Once the virtual machine has rebooted, complete login and immediately take a snapshot. Give it a descriptive name, such as “Activation and VM Tools Install” snapshot.REMnux SetupThe REMnux virtual machine downloads as an .ova file. I recommend you browse to docs.REMnux.org to confirm the hash of the downloaded OVA file.If you are using VirtualBox, you can just import REMnux, but if you are using VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation, follow these instructions to import the REMnux:  Select File-&gt;Import-&gt;Choose File… and select remnux-v7, hit Continue and then Save.  When the import is complete, click on Customize Settings.  Click into the Processors &amp; Memory pane under System Settings and leave the settings with two processor cores; reduce the memory from 4096MB to 2048MB.  For the REMnux network configuration, the setup is slightly different. We want to add an additional network adapter.Note: There are multiple reasons why I configure this virtual machine this way. If I need to update or download other software having the network adapter configured saves me time; the second is if I want to allow malware callouts.Once the import is complete and you’re in the “Settings” menu, select Network Adapter. The next step is to click Add Device… and select Network Adapter and Add…. Make sure the Share with my Mac radio button is set. Return to the main “Settings” panel and select Network Adapter 2. Click the vmnet2 radio button, then choose Show All to go back to Settings.  When starting the REMnux virtual machine, if prompted to upgrade the virtual machine to greater feature compatibility support, choose Upgrade.  Once REMnux boots, the credentials are: Username: remnux Password: malware.  I always change the password on my virtual machines:          $passwd UNIX password: malware Enter new UNIX password: (your choice)        The next step is to configure the network settings. If you type ifconfig -a you should see two network adapters:          Select NAT for the first network adapter. The virtual machine will get an address on that network from the VMware virtual DHCP server. You can ping google to see if you have connectivity or open the Firefox browser and connect to any website to confirm that you have internet access. If you do not, then type this command in terminal: $ sudo dhclient -r This should allow you to fetch an IP.      For the second adapter, ens37, type in this command:$ sudo ifconfig ens37 10.1.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.0        Hit the “Snapshot” button and name it something like “Clean Snapshot”.  Update and upgrade REMnux:$ sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgradeInstalling SentinelLabs RevCore ToolsOne of the reasons I wanted to create a SentinelLabs VM Bare Bones malware analysis toolkit was that when installing FlareVM, I find it contains many tools that I do not use, and it takes a minimum of 40 minutes to install. I wanted to create a script of the core tools and system configurations that I need to be able to analyze malware.Follow this procedure to instal SentinelLabs RevCore Tools on MSEdge WIndows 10:  Browse to the SentinelLabs RevCore Tools github page and download the zip.  Unzip it and drag the SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools_codeSnippet.ps1 script onto your desktop.  If you are using the free downloaded Windows 10 virtual machine that I’ve mentioned above go to Step 4; if you are using your own Windows virtual machine continue with these substeps:          Instead of dragging just the SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools_codeSnippet.ps1, drag the entire folder onto your virtual machine desktop.      Open the SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools_codeSnpippet.ps1 file and modify line 4 after -PackageName. You will modify the url and change it to the directory location on your desktop. E.g., 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SentineLabs/SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools/master/SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools.ps1' to 'c:UsersyourUsernameDesktopSentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools-mainSentinelLabRevCoreTools.ps1';              The final thing to do is to modify the SentinelLabsRevCoreTools.ps1. On lines 105-117, replace IEUser with the User profiles name you are using. Save all files and run the script. E.g.,        Install-ChocolateyShortcut -ShortcutFilePath “C:\\Users\\IEUser\\Desktop\\HxD.lnk” -TargetPath “C:\\Program Files\\HxD\\HxD.exe”        Install-ChocolateyShortcut -ShortcutFilePath “C:\\Users\\YourUser Profile\\Desktop\\HxD.lnk” -TargetPath “C:\\Program Files\\HxD\\HxD.exe”            Go to Step 5.        In the Windows 10 search bar, type powershell, right click and run as administrator. Browse to the location of the SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools_codeSnippet.ps1 powershell script, then run the script: .SentinelLabs_RevCore_Tools_codeSnippet.ps1.      The script will cause two automatic reboots, and you’ll need to log in again with your user password after each. The first reboot will continue disabling various system services that could otherwise hinder your malware analysis and continue to install the core tools. After the second reboot, the script will finalize and confirm all of the configurations and installations.The installed tools and modified system configurations are listed below. Don’t forget to take a snapshot when it’s finished and you’ve reached the “Type ENTER to exit” point.          Tools: Checksum, 7zip, Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPview, Sysmon, HxD, PEbear, PEStudio, PEsieve, Cmder, NXlog, X64dbg, X32dbg, Ollydbg, IDA-Free, Cutter, Ghidra, Openjdk11, Python3, PIP, PIP pefile, PIP YaraA tool that I frequently use is Hiew, Chocolatey does not have Hiew in its collection. My recommendation is to download and try out the free version, once you see the power of Hiew you should definitely purchase lifetime access because it is worth every penny.      System Configuration: Disabling – Bing Search, Game Bar Tips, Computer Restore, UAC, Update, Firewall, Windows Defender, Action Center Set Window Theme, Set Wallpaper, Create Shortcuts For Tools                ## Network Traffic Collection    When analyzing malware, often the malware operation and the C2s are still active, so an excellent way to stay under the radar is to run malware in a controlled environment. Analyzing network traffic is a trivial process in detecting malicious software callouts in real time network traffic. This section will help you configure your virtual machines to capture the detonated malicious software’s network traffic or statically step through debugged code, which allows your investigation to understand the potential threat at hand.    The first thing that must be configured is the virtual private network communication between the MSEdge Windows 10 and REMnux:          On the Windows 10 virtual machine, select the custom vmnet2 network (Virtual Machine-&gt;Network Adapter-&gt;Custom (vmnet2)).      On the Windows 10 VM, right click on the network adapter in the taskbar and choose Open Network &amp; Internet settings.      Select Ethernet and click on Change adapter options.      Right click on Ethernet0 and select Properties.      Double click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4).      Click the radio button to select “Use the following IP address:”, then add the IP address, Subnet mask, Default gateway, and Preferred DNS server as follows:                  IP Address: 10.1.2.100          Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0          Default Gateway: 10.1.2.1          Click the radio button to select “Use the following DNS server address:” and add:                          Preferred DNS Server: 10.1.2.1                                Click OK to complete configuration of the network settings.                          The REMnux adapter for the virtual private network has already been configured from the previous section.    Now that the virtual machines are networked and can communicate with each other, it is time to configure a few tools on the REMnux virtual machine to capture traffic.    Installed on REMnux are various tools you can use to capture network traffic. We will configure Burp Suite and INetSim. Burp Suite is typically used to test web application firewalls, but in our case we want to configure it so that when Windows 10 detonates malware, it will try to establish a connection to a domain or C2. The traffic will potentially use HTTPS and pass through Burp Suite, which will be bound to INetSim. INetSim is a software suite that simulates common services for lab environments to analyze malware’s network behavior.    ## Burp Suite Configuration    The Burp Suite setup is straightforward, but there are a couple of steps that we must configure before we can begin using it.          Open a command prompt and type: $ sudo Burp Suite.      select Temporary project, then hit Next and then Start Burp.      Select the Proxy tab and then “Options”. Under Proxy Listeners, select the default interface and click the Edit button.      Under the Binding tab, set Bind to address to Specific address: 10.1.2.1 and  click OK.                  IMPORTANT STEP:                  Go back to you MSEDGE Windows 10 virtual machine and open up the Edge browser.          Type in the address bar: http://10.1.2.1:8080. You should see “Burp Suite Community Edition”.          Download the CA Certificate on the top right side of the page.          Open the location of the file and double click on the certificate file.          Select Install Certificate....          Select Current User as the Store Location and click Next.          Select Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate. Click Next and then click Finish.          Go into the settings of the EDGE Browser and disable all security functionalities; this will help with testing the connection to INetSim in the next section.          Make sure you take a snapshot.                          Go back to the REMnux virtual machine. You should still be in Burp Suite Proxy tab, Edit proxy listener options.          Under the Request handling tab, set Redirect to host to localhost and Redirect to port to 4443. Select support for invisible proxying.      Now go to the Intercept tab and make sure intercept is off.      Under Proxy Listeners, select the default and click Edit      Under the Binding tab, Bind to address: Specific address: 10.1.2.1 should still be kept, but change the Bind to port 443      Click on the Request handling tab and set the Redirect to host option to localhost and Redirect to port to 4443.      Select the Support invisible proxying (enable only if needed.) and click OK.            ## INetSim Configuration Setup    REMnux has INetSim preinstalled. Use your favorite text editor and open up the inetsim.conf file located in /etc/inetsim/. Follow the steps to configure INetSim:          $ sudo vi /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf and enable all the services by uncommenting out the services by deleting the # character.Pro Tip: Be aware that malware could potentially detect it is running in a virtual environment by checking whether everything in this file is uncommented. I have yet to come across this, but it is good to be aware of the possibility. You could take a more conservative approach and only uncomment services you intend to use.      The next step is to bind the REMnux network adapter IP in the inetsim.conf file. The next section after the services menu is the service_bind_address. Uncomment the # and change the default IP address from 10.10.10.1 to 0.0.0.0.      Scroll down to the dns_default_ip section, uncomment the # and change the IP address from 10.10.10.1 to 10.1.2.1.      The last thing to do is to bind the HTTPS port so Burp Suite can route the traffic to the port 4443. Scroll down to the https_bind_port section, uncomment the # character and replace 443 with 4443.      Save the changes and exit the editor.              The next step is to run the following commands which are VERY IMPORTANT to execute or INetSim will not work correctly. Ubuntu has a system-resolved system service which provides network name resolution to local applications. This conflicts with INetSim so we need to disable the service.We have to disable system-resolve and also mask it so that it doesn’t auto start on reboot. Finally, we will stop the service.        $ sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved $ sudo systemctl mask systemd-resolved $ sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved                    The final step is to run INetSim: $ sudo inetsim![](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/17.-sudo-inetsim.jpg)        To test network connectivity from your Windows 10 virtual machine, open a command prompt and ping 10.1.2.1, then open Edge browser and type 10.1.2.1. You should see the following message “This is the default HTML page for INetSim HTTP server fake mode.”    The final test is to make sure the DNS is working correctly and serving up requests. For this example, I type in the search bar https://www.mymaliciousdomain.com/malwaretrojan.exe. If everything is working, you should see a web page warning that the requested site is not secure.        I also like using Wireshark to capture packets to analyze the pcaps when investigating malware.    Open a new tab in your terminal in REMnux and type $ wireshark.    Once the application has opened, click on the shark fin icon on the far left of the toolbar to begin capturing packets.        ## Detonating Malware    When malware is executed, it usually makes some request to a domain or IP address. INetSim helps with this by spoofing the responses to the malware that is waiting for a response. An example would be if malware was executed and reached out to a domain and will not proceed without a response unless the conditions were met, which is the response. If the malware doesn’t receive the response, it would terminate and not continue its malicious actions. This is where the live environment assists us with responding to callouts and capturing network traffic.    For the final step of the lab environment setup, we will detonate a notorious binary trojan (or any malware you choose) to test the configuration is working correctly.    I’m testing with a Trickbot binary (SHA256: 49d95cae096f7f73b3539568b450076227b4ca42c0240044a7588ddc1f1b6985). I’ve opened Process Explorer and TCPView to monitor the execution of this variant of Trickbot.            Detonating malware can save a lot of time before diving deep into reverse engineering as it allows you to gather insight and create an unbiased hypothesis. In this example, when we detonated this trickbot sample there were three callouts that stuck out:          The callouts were to fetch files from Microsoft Updates site; these cab files called were automatic updaters of untrusted certificates. A certificate trust list is a predefined list of items signed by a trusted entity. These requested cab files are used to update and expand the existing functionality by adding known untrusted certificates to the untrusted certificate store by using a certificate trust list.            Although Trickbot is one of the more prolific malware strains today and is more complex than a few callouts, it is a good starting point if you are in the beginning stages of research and have never encountered this binary.    I’ve been successfully using this lab setup for many years. A real-world example of using this lab setup occurred when I was brought in to help with an incident at short notice back in 2016. I didn’t have time for an initial triage of the binary as I was joining a war room call for the briefing by the investigation team lead. I started both VMs from snapshots and detonated the binary while being brought up to speed about the incident. Within 5 minutes, I informed the investigation lead about an IP that the specific binary was calling out to, which was enough to give the threat hunters a place to begin. After the war room call, I started reversing the malware and extracting additional IOCs and TTPs.    ## Conclusion    A lab environment setup and configuration varies during malware analysis. When analyzing malware you need different tools to dissect and do deep analysis. I hope the SentinelLabs RevCore Tools and configurations in this setup assists, but there might be a time that you need to analyze something different, like a dot net file, and may need an additional tool to fully disassemble the binary. The journey of reversing malware is a marathon and not a sprint; growing your skill and learning from every malware analyzed should be the goal.    ## Resources    https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2677070/an-automatic-updater-of-untrusted-certificates-is-available-for-window    https://askubuntu.com/questions/191226/dnsmasq-failed-to-create-listening-socket-for-port-53-address-already-in-use    https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Change-the-Desktop-b5b2141c    https://gist.github.com/trietptm/b84ccad9db01f459ac7e  https://www.amazon.com/Building-Virtual-Machine-Labs-Hands/dp/1546932631"

However, a lot of your projects are compiled in x86 and/or you are still building apps for x86, or whatever it is, you still want to compile the x86_64 code on your new Mac in the Terminal. You know it is possible with the Rosetta 2 (personally love it!). But how do you do it efficiently?While there are many ways of doing it, the following is the best one I have found to easily switch between the two architectures using just a simple Terminal command as below (actually hiding the command under an alias)..switching efficiently between x86_64 and arm64 using created aliasSo let’s look at what’s behind it, and how you too can easily set it up!The main command which does the magic is the one below:$env /usr/bin/arch -&lt;architecture&gt; /bin/zsh --login… just replace the __ with your preferred one..For example:  To see your current architecture, type:$archsee current architecture the Terminal is usingAs we see in the image above, I am currently using arm64, hence any code I compile will be for this architecture.  To switch to x86_64, type:==$env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh —-login==Now if you type the arch command again, you will see that the target architecture has been changed. Now you can go ahead and compile your code using Rosetta 2 for the x86_64 architecture.Creating alias in .zshrc:I don’t want to remember the whole command and type it all the time (obviously it’s not efficient). The simplest solution is to create an alias to it in the .zshrcJust cd into your home directory and open the .zshrc file.. If you don’t have one, you can easily create it using the touch command. (If you don’t know about it, there are already plenty of tutorials/write-ups online)..Here’s how my .zshrc file looks like.. I have named my aliases arm and intel for the arm and x8664 architectures respectively. You can name your aliases whatever you want. Just remember to relaunch the Terminal after updating and saving the .zshrc_ file.adding alias to .zshrcIgnoring the first line, you can see the two alias I have created for arm and intel. To switch, I just need to type the alias and that’s it!Bonus:If you only want to use the Terminal app with Rosetta 2 for the x8664 architecture, you can simple right click on the Terminal app in the _Applications&gt;Utilities, go the ‘Get Info’ and tick on “Open using Rosetta”"

If you’ve been looking for a good Diablo 4 Twisting Blades Rogue Build that allows you to quickly explode all your enemies, then this guide is for you!  The Level 50 version of this build evolves into the Shadowblade Build.Also, be sure to check out our Diablo 4 Wiki and Interactive Map if you need help finding specific Altars of Lilith, Dungeons, or Side Quests!Diablo 4 Shadow Rogue Build Guide – Twisting BladesThe way this Diablo 4 Shadow Rogue Build works is by using Shadow Imbuement in combination with Twisting Blades to generate a chain reaction of explosions that decimates big groups of enemies. To achieve this, you’ll start the fight by casting the **Shadow Imbuement** buff, then you’ll head straight into a pack of enemies and perform two attacks with Twisting Blades (you can hit the same enemy or two different enemies).Now, you’ll use Dash to pass through the group and get on the exact opposite side and start attacking using your Invigorating Strike (this will build up combo points and increase your Energy regeneration). At this point, the first two attacks you made with Twisting Blades will return to you passing through the pack of enemies. This will deal damage to all of them and apply the Shadow Imbuement debuff, which will generate a chain-reaction of explosions. Also, because of the Advanced Twisting Blades Upgrade, both your Shadow Imbuement and Dash cooldown’s will be reduced, and thanks to Consuming Shadows you’ll get back the energy you spent, allowing you to restart the sequence.Once you are on the opposite side, you can use Invigorating Strike to increase Energy Regeneration and to build up 3 combo points, which will greatly increase the damage of your Twisting Blades, so even if you are not able to cast Shadow Imbuement right away, the daggers will deal even more damage on the second pass, allowing you to finish off any remaining enemies.The aspect that will help the most here is the Bladedancer’s Aspect, making it so that the returning blades orbit around you in the end to deal extra damage, which is very useful to finish off the enemies or to deal with Elites. This new Orbit Damage is further amplified based on the enemies pierced by the boomerang effect. You can acquire the Codex of Power of this aspect by completing the Jalal’s Vigil Dungeon, located at Scosglen.I recommend using Combo Points Specialization to fight regular enemies, as it’ll increase the damage of your Twisting Blades, and also give you a Speed Buff, but you should swap to Inner Sight Specialization when fighting Bosses. Doing so will allow you to spam the Twisting Blades skill when Inner Sight is active, dealing a ton amount of damage and generating a massive amount of orbiting blades that quickly ticks the boss health’s down. Remember that you’ll also invest points into the Shadow Clone Ultimate to be able to summon your shadow who will mimic this action, further increasing the burst damage.Diablo 4 Twisting Blades Rogue Build Guide – Skill DistributionEach Diablo 4 Shadow Rogue Build is made up of the 6 Active Skills they have equipped and changing these Skills can drastically alter the way the Rogue Class in Diablo IV plays. In this section, we’ll take a look at what Skills you should slot for the Twisting Blades Rogue Diablo 4 Build. Your Skill distribution should look something like this:                                      LEVEL 25 SHADOW ROGUE SKILLS                     Skill      Points Spent              Invigorating Strike      1              Enhanced Invigorating Strike      1              Twisting Blades      5              Enhanced Twisting Blades      1              Advanced Twisting Blades      1              Shadow Step      1              Dash      1              Exploit      3              Malice      2              Shadow Crash      1              Consuming Shadows      2              Shadow Imbuement      3              Enhanced Shadow Imbuement      1              Blended Shadow Imbuement      1              Shadow Clone      1              Prime Shadow Clone      1      The above list gives you the general order to invest in Skills, but keep in mind that you should prioritize picking up new Active Skills over investing in passives, so pick up passives later if you can get new Active Skills when you level up.Diablo 4 Shadow Rogue Build – How to Handle Packs of EnemiesSo there are several different strategies to employ with this Diablo IV Build for the Twisting Blades Rogue, and these change depending on whether you’re facing a large group of enemies or a Boss. Let’s start with a group of enemies first, and we’ll cover how to handle Bosses in the next section.Shadow ImbuementAs with the rest of the Diablo IV Builds for the Rogue Class, you’ll be able to choose the type of damage you deal. For this Twisting Blades Rogue, we’re going to pick Shadow Imbuement to convert your damage into Shadow Damage and infect multiple targets. To infect a target you must strike it with a Shadow Imbued skill, we’ll achieve this by first sticking a shadow imbued Twisting Blade into an enemy, and then making it pass through the other enemies when it returns to us.When an infected target is killed, it will explode, dealing massive damage to all surrounding enemies, generating a chain reaction that decimate big groups. In addition to this, our Blended Shadow Imbuement upgrade will make them Vulnerable, so after the first explosion everything else will die even faster.Twisting BladesTwisting Blades is key to this build, because of its boomerang effect. Enemies often attack you in a line pattern, so you’ll want to strike the first one or two enemies and then reposition behind them. After 1.5 second, the blades will return to you, passing through the pack and applying the Shadow Debuff and dealing massive individual damage thanks to the Enhanced Twisting Blades, which will allow you to kill some enemies and trigger the chain explosion. You’ll want to prioritize positioning to maximize the amount of enemies you hit when the blade returns, as each enemy hit will reduce all of your active cooldowns by 0.25 second for each enemy hit thanks to the Advanced Twisting Blades Upgrade.Since this is the main skill of your Twisting Blades Rogue Diablo 4 Build, you’ll want to max it out and then get Enhanced Twisting Blades together with Advanced Twisting Blades as soon as possible.Invigorating StrikeInvigorating Strike is a Basic Skill for this D4 Build that allows you to deal a small amount of damage, but also increases your Energy Regeneration and has a 50% Lucky Hit Chance, which is very nice to have. Since you’ll be using the Combo Points Specialization against regular enemies, so each attack you perform will give you 1 combo point. Ideally, you’ll want to use your starter combination of Shadow Imbue and Twisting Blades to then dash behind the enemy group and start attack perform three attacks with Invigorating Strike. This will give you 20% Energy Regeneration, or 50% if the enemy is either Injured or Crowed Controlled.Also, if you happen to have a very good Lucky Hit Chance skill on your equipment, you can also go for Primary Invigorating Strike to further increase the proc chance, but it’s not mandatory for this build.DashWe’ll be using dash to quickly navigate through the open map, and also to quickly reposition behind the pack of enemies at the beginning of the fight. Note that Dash has 2 charges, so make sure you always have at least 1 charge available when engaging a group of enemies, or you won’t be able to reposition to activate your combo. You won’t need enhancements for this Skill since it’ll be primarily used for movementShadow StepShadow Step is an essential survivability tool of this Twisting Blades Rogue D4 Build, since your Health and defenses aren’t all that great. When activated, you’ll automatically gain Unstoppable, which removes and prevents all control impairing effects. This allows you to break out of critical situations, such as getting froze or stunned.In addition, the skill will perform a lucky hit with a 100% chance on the target enemy, and provide you 50% movement speed for 2 seconds, giving you the chance to drink a potion and reposition to a safe place.You can also use Shadow Step to quickly reposition behind an enemy to take full advantage of the Twisting Blades Boomerang effect, but you should only do this if you are certain you are not going to get affected by a control impairing effect.You won’t need the enhancement or upgrade, since we’ll be mainly using it as an emergency survival tool.PassivesFor passives of this Diablo 4 Twisting Blades Rogue Build, you’ll be taking Shadow Crash to gain access to Consuming Shadows. Shadow Crash raises the chances of Stunning enemies when they receive Shadow Damage which works great for elites, but the Skill you’ll want more is Consuming Shadows, hence the 2-point investment. This lets you generate all the Energy you spent in the combo, provided that you kill them with the Shadow Imbuement.The other passive that you’ll want to take are Exploit and Malice.Exploit increases the damage you deal to both Healthy and Injured enemies. Since you’ll first deal damage to enemies with full health, and then deal with the remaining ones, this passive is active practically all the time.Malice increases the damage you deal to Vulnerable enemies, which synergizes perfectly with the Blended Shadow Imbuement that makes enemies vulnerable after the explosions.Rogue Build for Boss FightsBoss fights are handled a bit differently with this Diablo 4 Twisting Blades Rogue Build. First, you’ll want to swap your specialization from Combo Points for Inner Sight. Inner Sight allows you’ll fill up a gauge when attacking the marked enemy, Bosses are often alone, so you’ll be filling the gauge by attacking it. Once the gauge is full, you’ll gain unlimited energy for 4 seconds. At that moment, you’ll want to spawn your Shadow Clone, cast Shadow Imbuement and then start spamming Twisting Blade as much as you can. As the blades return, they’ll start circling around you, stacking tons of damage into the boss.Shadow CloneShadow Clone is an ultimate ability that will provide you with aid by conjuring your own shadow to copy the actions you’re pulling off. Although the damage won’t be as potent, it’s still a great way of increasing our single target damage. You can also invest in Prime Shadow Clone to have another option to make you Unstoppable every time Shadow Clone is activated.Make sure to use your dash to avoid boss attacks or to quickly disengage from combat to drink a potion and recover your health. Same as with regular enemies, you’ll want to save Shadow Step for when you are affected by a movement impairing effect. Finally, remember that you can also use your Shadow Clone Ultimate to the same end, thanks to Prime Shadow Clone which provides you Unstoppable for 5 seconds.Final TipsFor this Diablo 4 Twisting Blades Rogue Build, you should be on the lookout for gear that gives bonuses to Dexterity, Intelligence, Maximum Energy, +Rank to relevant skills, Critical Strike Chance, Critical Strike Damage Bonus, Damage to Close Enemies, Imbuement Skill Damage, Core Skill Damage, Energy Cost Reduction, and Cooldown Reduction. Damage Reduction is also good to pick up where you’re often susceptible to taking in lots of damage in the melee range. It’s a pretty OP D4 Rogue Build due to the massive burst damage you deal.You can run around the map and stack a couple of enemy groups and engage all of them at the same time for maximum efficiency. Make sure to prioritize positioning over attacking individual targets.When it comes to Legendary Aspects, you’ll also want to get the Aspect of Lethal Dusk and Ravenous Aspect for this Diablo 4 Build. Lethal Dusk grants Stealth when evading through a Shadow Imbuement infect enemy, which is great if you need to recover or reposition, and on top of that, it will give you a buff that grants you 1~5% of maximum life recovered on kill for 4 seconds. Meanwhile, Ravenous Aspect rewards you with increased Energy regeneration when a Vulnerable enemy is slain, which works hand-in-hand with Blended Shadow Imbuement."

    "content": "Diablo 4 HellTide EventsWhen you guys hit World Tier 3, do helltide events everytime you can, they’re stupidly important because they’re the only source of Forgotten Souls and you need a lot of them to keep upgrading/rerolling gear. I skimped out on them and wish I didn’t now.      There is a timer for the Helltide Event here: https://d4events.live/ - The event is up for one hour and then down for 1 hour 15 minutes until the next one.        The general gist of Helltides is roam around, kill packs for cinders, do world events (more mobs more cinders) and open Helltide Chests        When Hellfire meteors rain down, it means a Helltide Elite is spawning nearby and they drop a fair amount as well        Forgotten Souls can also come from normal helltide chests, and Screaming Hell Veins        This site shows the POSSIBLE spawn locations of the mystery chests - https://d4armory.io/map/ These require 175 cinders to open and can give a bunch of legs and crafting mats (ex - https://i.imgur.com/oGb2dvc.jpeg) The chests DO NOT SHOW on the map (until you are very close, and when you go away, the icon will disappear) so if you find it, pin NEAR it (not on the chest icon otherwise it will disappear) and come back if you can’t open it. PRIO THESE CHESTS OVER ALL        Mystery Chests will move at the top of the hour (When the IRL clock hits xx:00) meaning you can get multiple chests. Multiple can spawn at once with one per large region zone.        The official D4 server has a channel for people to post where the chests are located during events - https://discord.com/invite/diablo4#discord  Edit 1: - /u/Prowner1 has made a site and added a Helltide Tracker to it which allows inputs from users to show where the chests are on the current event - https://diablo4.life/trackers/helltideEdit 2: Changed the Mystery Chest movement time, it appears to be top of the hour. (The chests moving is honestly the most confusing part)I fucking hate this event and hope they allow you to get Forgotten Souls somewhere else in the game.https://d4events.live/"

All of your existing code block admonitions will continue to work, and will always work!  You can continue to use Admonitions to create custom types, and all of your custom types will just work as a callout, without you having to do anything!  If you have any Microsoft Document syntax admonitions, they will have to be converted to the new callout box syntax - there is a button in Admonition settings to auto-convert these for you.  You can use Admonitions to set default titles, default collapse states, or defaulting to not having a title.  Admonitions adds helpful editor suggestors for quickly entering your custom callout boxes.  Admonitions adds helpful commands for inserting callout boxes, including the ability to register commands for specific types.UsagePlace a code block with the admonition type:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.Becomes:Options```ad- # Admonition type. See below for a list of available types.title:                  # Admonition title.collapse:               # Create a collapsible admonition.icon:                   # Override the icon.color:                  # Override the color.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.Please note that as of **4.4.1**, the `title`, `collapse`, `icon` and `color` parameters must be at the _top_ of the block, in any order.### TitleThe admonition will render with the type of admonition by default. If you wish to customize the title, you can do so this way:```ad-notetitle: TitleLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.Custom titles are rendered as Markdown, so they support the full Obsidian Markdown syntax.Leave the title field blank to only display the admonition.title:Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.CollapsibleUse the collapse parameter to create a collapsible admonition.collapse: open will start the admonition opened on render, but allow collapse on click.If a blank title is provided, the collapse parameter will not do anything.Admonitions may be set to be collapsible by default in settings.IconThe admonition icon can be overridden using the icon parameter. The icon name entered must be the exact icon name from FontAwesome or RPGAwesome.```ad-noteicon: triforceLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.```ColorThe admonition color can be overridden using the color parameter. The color entered must be an RGB triad.```ad-notecolor: 200, 200, 200Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla.```No ContentAn admonition with no content will render as just the title block.```ad-note```Nesting AdmonitionsNesting admonitions may be done by increasing the number of backticks.Example:`````ad-notetitle: Nested Admonitionscollapse: openHello!````ad-notetitle: This admonition is nested.This is a nested admonition!```ad-warningtitle: This admonition is closed.collapse: close```````This is in the original admonition.`````Rendering Code Blocks inside AdmonitionsCode blocks may be nested inside admonitions using a method similar to Nesting Admonitions above.Additionally, for a single layer, the ~~~ markdown codeblock syntax may be used:````ad-info```ad-bugtitle: I'm Nested!~~~javascriptthrow new Error(\"Oops, I'm a bug.\");~~~``````javascriptconsole.log(\"Hello!\");```````Admonition TypesThe following admonition types are currently supported:TypeAliasesnotenote, seealsoabstractabstract, summary, tldrinfoinfo, todotiptip, hint, importantsuccesssuccess, check, donequestionquestion, help, faqwarningwarning, caution, attentionfailurefailure, fail, missingdangerdanger, errorbugbugexampleexamplequotequote, citeSee this for a reference of what these admonitions look like.The default admonitions are customizable by creating a user-defined admonition of the same name.Custom Admonitions &amp; CalloutsCustom admonitions may be created in settings. Creating a custom admonition will also enable it to be used as an Obsidian callout.Creating a new admonition requires three things: the type, the icon to use, and the color of the admonition.Only one admonition of each type may exist at any given time; if another admonition of the same type is created, it will override the previously created one.If a default admonition is overridden, it can be restored by deleting the user-defined admonition.Please note that by default, the background color of the title is simply the color of the admonition at 10% opacity. CSS must be used to update this.Images as IconsImages can be uploaded to use as an admonition icon instead of an icon from a downloaded icon set.These images will be resized to 24px x 24px to be stored in the plugin’s saved data.To remove an image icon, simply choose an icon in the icon chooser text box.Global CommandsSeveral commands are available for the plugin by default.Collapse and Open All Admonitions In NoteIf these two commands are triggered with an open note, all collapsible admonitions will be collapsed or open respectively.Insert AdmonitionThis will open a modal where the admonition type, title and collapse behavior can be set, then the generated admonition code block will be inserted into the open editor.Admonition-specific commandsCommands may be registered for each custom admonition type to insert them into an open note by clicking the Register Commands button in Settings.3 commands will be registered: Insert &lt;type&gt; Callout, Insert &lt;type&gt;, and Insert &lt;type&gt; with Title.Insert CalloutThe selected type will be inserted as an Obsidian callout, and any selected text will be included with it.InsertThe selected type will be inserted as a codeblock admonition, and any selected text will be included with it.Insert with TitleThe selected type will be inserted as a codeblock admonition, and any selected text will be included with it. The title: parameter will also be added and the cursor will be placed at that line.Mermaid GraphsMermaid graphs are supported by Admonitions, but with some caveats:  You cannot combine mermaid graphs and embeds/transclusions.  Mermaid graphs do not work in collapsed-by-default admonitions.Non-code block Admonitions  ❗ This syntax has been officially removed as of Admonitions 7.0.0.  Use the Obsidian Callout box syntax instead!As of version 6.0.0, there is a new setting: Enable Non-codeblock Admonitions.This setting is highly experimental and may not work as expected, and there are a few caveats listed at the end of this section to keep in mind.This setting allows for creating an admonition without wrapping it in a code block, which means that links and tags will sync into Obsidian’s cache. A non-codeblock admonition may be created using the following syntax:!!! ad-&lt;type&gt; Title goes here!content--- admonitionThis will create the appropriate admonition type, embed the content, and give it the supplied title.TitlesTitles should be placed after the admonition block. Currently, markdown in titles is not supported.An empty title can be created by either placing two spaces after the admonition type:!!! ad-&lt;type&gt;content--- admonitionor by placing empty double quotes:!!! ad-&lt;type&gt; \"\"content--- admonitionCollapsibleA collapsible admonition may be created using the following syntax:??? ad-&lt;type&gt; Title goes here!content--- admonitionA collapsible admonition may default to “open” by appending a +:???+ ad-&lt;type&gt; Title goes here!content--- admonitionCaveats  Changes to the admonition after render require the cache to be cleared. The note must be closed and re-opened (and sometimes, a different note must be opened first).          This is all changes, including the admonition type, title, content, even whether or not a collapsible admonition is open or closed initially.        Nested admonitions are not currently supported.If you experience any bugs using this setting, please create an issue and I will look into them.Microsoft Document Syntax  ❗ This syntax has been officially removed as of version 8.0.0.  Use the Obsidian Callout box syntax instead!As of v6.8.0, an additional non-code block syntax can be used that is inspired by the Microsoft Document Syntax to render admonitions.  ⚠️ Please note:  Unlike the Microsoft Document Syntax, the type is not required to be upper case.  The plugin will use an exact-match first, then try to find a case-insensitive match.  [!quote]This is an admonition!This syntax can also be used on indented code blocks:[!quote]This is an admonition!TitleA title can be added to the MSDoc-style admonition by appending it after the type.  [!quote: This is the title!]This is an admonition!Like the code block syntax, providing an empty title will remove the title from the rendered admonition.  [!quote:]This admonition won’t have a title!CollapseCollapse can be set by appending the following characters after the brackets:CharacterCollapse Type+open-closedxnonePublishObsidian plugins do not work on publish sites; however, version 6.4.0+ has an option to generate a JavaScript file that can be used on Publish sites with custom domains.Obsidian Publish only allows external JavaScript on publish sites with custom domains. If your Publish is ran through Obsidian, this will not work.Instructions:  Go the Admonition settings tab and click the “Generate JS for Publish” button.  Save the JavaScript file.  Copy the contents of the JS file to your publish.js file.  Add the contents of the assets/main.css file to your publish.css file.Please note that I can give no guarantees of stability on your publish site. Other JavaScript you include may conflict with this file. If you run into an issue using it, please create an issue on this repository and I will try to help you.Icon PacksAdditional icon packs can be downloaded in settings.Adding Icon PacksWant to add an existing icon pack? Make a pull request with the following:  Add a new folder in the icons folder with the name of your icon set.  Create an icons.json file that has the icons defined as an Object. Please see the Octicons json for reference.  Put your icon pack’s information in the two variables in the Icon Packs file.SettingsCustom Admonition TypesCustom admonition types can be created and managed in this section of the settings.Export Custom Types as CSSThis button will generate a CSS snippet that you can save and use for your custom callout types.Importing Custom AdmonitionsCustom admonitions can be imported in settings from a JSON array of definitions.At a minimum, you only need a valid admonition type:[    {        “type”: “my-custom-type”    }]This will use the pencil-alt FontAwesome icon and a random color, and set all other properties as false.However, you can specify an icon and color as well:[    {        “type”: “my-custom-type”,        “icon”: “globe”,        “color”: “120,120,120”    }]If you want to specify an icon pack, you can do so like this:[    {        “type”: “my-custom-type”,        “icon”: {            “name”: “globe”,            “type”: “font-awesome”        },        “color”: “120,120,120”    }]All of the possible fields are defined here.Admonition SettingsSettings specific to admonitions are managed in this section.Add Drop ShadowA drop shadow will be added to admonitions by default.If this setting is off, rendered admonitions will receive the .no-drop class.Collapsible By DefaultAll admonitions will be collapsible by default, unless collapse: none is set in the admonition parameters.Default Collapse Type  ⚠️ This setting is only available when Collapsible By Default is true.Set the default collapse type used when setting an admonition collapsible by default.Add Copy ButtonA “Copy Content” button will be added to the top-right corner of the admonition &amp; callout content.Parse Titles as MarkdownTurn this setting off to prevent admonition titles from being rendered as markdown.Set Admonition ColorsControls whether or not a rendered admonition will receive a color.Turn this off to totally control color via CSS.Hide Empty AdmonitionsAdmonitions with no content are hidden by default.  ⚠️ Please note that this only works for Admonitions that have no text content whatsoever.Icon PacksUse Font Awesome IconsThe plugin comes pre-bundled with the entire Font Awesome Free icon set. Turn this setting off to not include them in the icon picker.Existing custom Admonitions that use Font Awesome icons will continue to work.Additional Icon PacksAdditional icon packs can be downloaded to supplement the included Font Awesome Free icon set.Downloading an icon pack requires an internet connection.Current additional icon packs available are the Octicons set and the RPG Awesome set.  📝 For backwards compability, if an Admonition was created prior to version 7.0.0 using an RPG Awesome icon, the pack will try to be downloaded.Additional SyntaxesObsidian 0.14 has introduced Callout boxes to its core functionality using a similar syntax to the Microsoft Document callouts.This has rendered the Microsoft Document syntax for Admonitions obsolete, but Admonitions can still be used to create and manage your custom callout types.Your existing code block Admonitions will always work!Enable Non-codeblock Admonitions  ❗ This setting has been removed as of version 7.0.0.  It is recommended to use the Obsidian Callout box instead.Enabled use of !!! ad-&lt;type&gt; style admonitions.
